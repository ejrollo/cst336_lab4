                        being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred 
                        to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives 
                        it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. </p>
