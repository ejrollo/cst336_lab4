                        larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars is the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred 
                        to as the "Red Planet". The Red Planet designation refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives 
                        it the distinctive reddish appearance, unique among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. </p>
