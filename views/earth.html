                        Only 29% of Earth's surface is land with the remaining 71% covered with water, consisting of
                        mostly oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water. 
                        Earth's atmosphere is made up of mostly nitrogen and oxygen. Tropical regions receive more energy from the Sun than the polar regions, 
                        which is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Earth's interior is made up of a still active solid iron inner core, 
                        a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics. </p>
