                        About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, 
                        mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. 
                        Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic 
                        plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, 
                        a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics. </p>
